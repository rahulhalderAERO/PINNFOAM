## 🔗 PINNFOAM - Coupling Full-Order and Reduced-Order Model with PINN

We aim to couple the Full Order Model (FOM) and the Reduced Order Model (ROM), both of which are computed using the Finite Volume-based solver **OpenFOAM**.  For background and preliminary work, we encourage readers to consult the authors' initial study:

# FOM + PINN

In the current codes, we first demonstrate how to couple a full-order model (FOM) with a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) using an example of a nonlinear conservation law equation.
