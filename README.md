## 🔗 PINNFOAM - Coupling Full-Order and Reduced-Order Model with PINN

We aim to couple the Full Order Model (FOM) and the Reduced Order Model (ROM), both of which are computed using the Finite Volume-based solver **OpenFOAM**.  For background and preliminary work, we encourage readers to consult the authors' initial study:

And the available Codes:

In the current Codes, we first demonstrate how to couple a full-order model with an example of a Nonlinear Conservation Law Equation with the PINN.
